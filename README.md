# generative-adversial-networks
This repository contains code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images from random noise. The model architecture consists of a Generator and Discriminator, implemented using TensorFlow 2.x and trained with a gradient-based optimization approach using tf.GradientTape.
